Should we print additional information about the indicator on each candle?  Candle Size Multiplier:  Whole numbers only, used for aggregation. E.g. set to 3 if on 5 min candles and 15min indicator period is desired. A more advanced feature to offer per-indicator fine-tuning.  Trade Volume:  Percentage of available asset and currency\n        evaluated on each trade. 50 is 50%. Only used on combined\n        indicators.

Single Trade:  Should we only do a single sell or buy?\n        This still uses Trade Volume percent on each trade.
